        "details": "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",
        "details1": "Module 1: Introduction and Course-Wide Information (Start Here)",
        "details1_info": "Welcome! Start here! Learn about this course and how it's organized.",
        "details2": "Module 2: Software Installation and Homework 0",
        "details2_info": "This module contains two things: (1) The information for the [unusual] software you need to install for Programming Languages Part A. (2) An optional fake homework that you can turn in for auto-grading and peer assessment to get used to the mechanics of assignment turn-in that we will use throughout the course. You can do this module either before or after watching the first few actual course content videos in the next module, but you will want to get the software installed soon so you can learn by actively trying out variations on the code in the videos. You will need to install the software to do the homework.",
        "details3": "Module 3: Section 1 and Homework 1",
        "details3_info": "It's time to dive in! Start with a careful reading of the Section 1 Welcome Message and go from there.",
        "details4": "Module 4: Section 2 and Homework 2",
        "details4_info": "This section is a particularly rewarding one where a lot of ideas come together to reveal a surprisingly elegant underlying structure in ML. As usual, start with the welcome reading, dive into the material, and leave plenty of time to approach the programming assignment methodically.",
        "details5": "Module 5: Section 3 and Homework 3 -- and Course Motivation",
        "details5_info": "This section is all about higher-order functions -- the feature that gives functional programming much of its expressiveness and elegance -- and its name! As usual, the first reading below introduces you to the section, but it will make more sense once you dive in to the lectures.",

        "pro_course1": "It can enhance problem-solving skills  Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge.",

        "pro_course3": "Since programmer's tasks include a complex and multifaceted ability, coding offers assistance reinforce associations between the distinctive parts of the brain. It increases creativity, analyzing problems, and logical thinking of solving problems and boosts the brain's capacity to learn",
